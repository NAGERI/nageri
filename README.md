# Nageri Portfolio

_Minimal is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/minimal), and use it today, just like [NAGERI](https://github.com/nageri) did ðŸ˜Ž._

In all my public repos, I have worked on personal projects while learning to use tools and languages, which include:

- Languages
  - Bash
  - python
  - Java
  - Javascript
  - SQL
- CI/CD
  - Kubernetes
  - ArgoCD
  - Helm
  - Travis-ci
  - Docker-compose
- Docker
- Flutter (Dart)
- NodeJS

I am still learning for growth, while adding and enforcing my knowledge on those which I already know, so as to be dynamic as possible.
