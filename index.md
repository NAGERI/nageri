# **Who am I?**

I am a fullstack software developer who also loved DevOps paracties and, always automating my applications.  
I have bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Makerere University.  
Am a open-minded, free spirit and festive guy.
I am a Ugandan with Kenyan roots, I guess that makes me East African 💪👨‍💻.

# **What I do!**

I am a persionate, solution seeking programmer, I stick with the problem long enough to solve it,
willing to go far and wide, to keep my self up-to-date in this field of I.T. (_Still moving..._)

### I solve problems with code...

## Leadership

Over the years I have acquired better communication and leadership skills. I find myself being singled out of a group, to be their lead.  
During campus days I was a chairperson of a _students' christian fellowship._  
When I was doing my internship at [Airtel Uganda](https://www.airtel.co.ug/) in 2019, I was selected to lead my colleages in a cross-functional project that involved all students in different departments.  
We always work together with colleagues to achieve the common goal, that made us a group.
